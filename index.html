    <p>Bayard was born on March 17, 1912, in the city of West Chester Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p>Due to his grandparent's involvement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Bayard was exposed to civil rights activism early in his life. This influence lead to him campaigning against Jim Crow laws early in his life. </p>
    <p>Bayard started attending Wilberforce University, a historically black college located in Ohio, in 1932, but was later expelled in 1936, after organizing a strike. He attended the HeadersState Teachers College, now the Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, for a brief time, before moving to New York and attending the City College of New York.</p>
    <p>Rustin combined ideas of socialism with the pacifism of the Quaker religion and the teachings of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mahatma Ghandi.</a></p>
    <p>During WWII, Bayard worked with African American labor leader <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph">Asa  Philip Randolph</a>, to combat the discrimination present in war industry workforce. </p>

        <ul> <p>Many times throughout his life, Bayard was jailed or punished for his beliefs. Some of this more notable arrests:</p>
            <li>He served 2 years during the war for his refusal to register for the draft.</li>
            <li>In 1947 he was sentenced to work on a chain gang for weeks, for his roles in protests against the segregated public transit system.</li>
            <li>in 1953 he was arrested and spent 60 days in jail for a morals charge, for engaging in homosexual activity in public.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>After his 1953 jailing, he continued to live his life as an openly gay man. However because of his sexuality, much of his time was spent out of the spotlight. Even some fellow members of the civil rights movement tried to discredit him because he was gay. Despite the discrimination he faced, nothing stopped him from trying to effect change.</p>
    <p>Rustin is mostly known for his works as a civil rights leader as it relates to the African American community, but he also did much work for other oppressed groups. An example of this was traveling to California to work on protecting the property of Japanese-Americans who were sent to interment camps. 

    </p>
    <p>Rustin spent a lot of time with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and is credited with introducing Dr. King to Ghandi's teachings of non-violence. He would continue to serve as an advisor and "nonviolence strategist" to Dr. King.</p>

    <p>Bayard was one of the key organizers, along with Asa Philip Randolph, of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">March on Washington</a>, where Dr. King delivered his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnXwgvwretw">I Have A Dream speech.</a> </p>

    <p>Bayard died in his home in New York City on May 16, 1979 at the age of 90.<br>
        On August 8, 2013, 34 years after his death, President Barack Obama awarded Bayard with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. </p>
